<p>Hello everyone my name is Mason, today I’ll be talking about myself about what I have interest in IT. Initially I was interested playing video games on the desktop which led me to undertake a certificate 3 in IT and completed it in 2019. I am over fascinated with building, upgrading/modification and servicing computers so they can work. I am furthering my studies to upgrade my skills and knowledge on computers as I would like to be able to work in the IT industry and make new friends. When I was younger, I wasn’t quite sure what I wanted to do, I had no Idea what I was doing but at the time I was interested in building projects at my school and playing video games on the ps4. I have chosen to study with RMIT because when I started doing diploma at Tafe it was very hard and confusing.</p>

<p>One of the people that I know who had studied at RMIT suggested that I should go there because they are way better at understanding and can also help, so I then got myself enrolled into the IT course at RMIT. What are the things I’ll be learning during my studies at RMIT, at the start of the course I had a feeling that it would all just be about coding and not working in a group for assignments in the future, so far all I know is a little bit of java that I am learning currently now.</p>

<p>The position of this job is self-employment, working for a self-employment is really good because you have a lot of responsibility. This job appeals to me because you can work from home and do troubleshooting. The skill set you need to be able to do is work with mac + IOS, Android, etc. be able to diagnose, troubleshoot, great customer support. The skills that I currently have are, building desktops, very little knowledge on java and troubleshooting. How will I get the skills and qualification that I would need are, learning how to use voltage as I don’t have a clue to use it.</p>

<h2>Personal Profile</h2>

<p>The results from the tests means to me doesn’t really mean anything because over years people change so my answer might never be the same but it might. I think that the results may influence my behavior in a group team might be good because I will always keep asking questions that are more like ‘what if it doesn’t work?’ or ‘will it work’, ‘how does it work?’, etc. I can that this knowledge from the creativity test and work on getting better with interacting with people more often and more get involved with other people.</p>
